<h2 id="subtitulo">Reclaimed Water:</h2>
<p id="texto">Water reuse (also commonly known as water recycling or water reclamation) is one of the many different alternatives to avoid water wastage and allowing polluted water to go back to nature. In this process consists of reclaiming water from a variety of sources then treating and reuseing it for beneficial purposes such as agriculture and irrigation, potable water supplies, groundwater replenishment, industrial processes, and environmental restoration. Water reuse can provide alternatives to existing water supplies and be used to enhance water security, sustainability, and resilience.
</p>
<p id="texto1">Water reuse can be defined as planned or unplanned. Unplanned water reuse refers to situations in which a source of water is substantially composed of previously-used water. A common example of unplanned water reuse occurs when communities draw their water supplies from rivers, such as the Colorado River and the Mississippi River, that receive treated wastewater discharges from communities upstream.
</p>
<p id="texto2">Planned water reuse refers to water systems designed with the goal of beneficially reusing a recycled water supply. Often, communities will seek to optimize their overall water use by reusing water to the extent possible within the community, before the water is reintroduced to the environment. Examples of planned reuse include agricultural and landscape irrigation, industrial process water, potable water supplies, and groundwater supply management.

 <h2 id="titulolista">Uses for reclaimed water: Irrigation for agriculture</h2>
<ul id="lista">
    <li>Irrigation for landscaping such as parks, rights-of-ways, and golf courses
    </li>
    <li>Municipal water supply
    </li>
    <li>Process water for power plants, refineries, mills, and factories
    </li>
    <li>Indoor uses such as toilet flushing
    </li>
    <li>Dust control or surface cleaning of roads, construction sites, and other trafficked areas
    </li>
    <li>Concrete mixing and other construction processes
    </li>
    <li>Supplying artificial lakes and inland or coastal aquifers
    </li>
    <li>Environmental restoration
    </li>
</ul>
<p id="texto3">Although reclaiming water is great to lower the overall level of water consumption, it is important to regulate the whole process to ensure that it is done correctly. Research shows that residual pathogens are frequently present in recycled water and pose health risks. Therefore it is crucial that we understand how to recycle water safely in order to ensure the safety of all potential users.
