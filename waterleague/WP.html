    <h1 id="WP">Water Pollution and Water Waste</h1>
<p id="parrafo1">Polluted water is water whose composition has been changed to the extent that it is unusable. In other words, it is toxic water that cannot be drunk or used for essential purposes like agriculture,and which also causes diseases like diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid and poliomyelitis that kill more than 500,000 people worldwide every year.
    <br>The main water pollutants include bacteria, viruses, parasites, fertilizers, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, nitrates, phosphates, plastics, fecal waste and even radioactive substances. These substances do not always change the colour of the water, meaning that they are often invisible pollutants. That's why small amounts of water and aquatic organisms are tested to determine water quality.

            <p>Rising global temperatures caused by CO2 emissions heat the water, reducing its oxygen content.

        <h1 id="problem">Consequences</h1>
        <p id="parrafo1">Deteriorating water quality is damaging the environment, health conditions and the global economy. Here are some examples:</p>
       <div id="lista"> <ul>
            <li>Destruction of biodiversity:  Water pollution depletes aquatic ecosystems and triggers unbridled proliferation of phytoplankton in lakes.
            </li>
            <li>Contamination of the food chain: Fishing in polluted waters and the use of waste water for livestock farming and agriculture can introduce toxins into foods which are harmful to our health when eaten.
            </li>
            <li>Lack of potable water: The UN says that billions of people around the world have no access to clean water to drink or sanitation, particularly in rural areas.
            </li>
            <li>Diseases: The WHO estimates that about 2 billion people have no option but to drink water contaminated by excrement, exposing them to diseases such as cholera, hepatitis A and dysentery.
            </li>
            <li>Infant mortality: According to the UN, diarrheal diseases linked to lack of hygiene cause the death of about 1,000 children a day worldwide.
            </li>
            <li>Interrupt economic growth: when biological oxygen demand — the indicator that measures the organic pollution found in water — exceeds a certain threshold, the growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the regions within the associated water basins falls by a third.
