                To solve the plastic pollution in the oceans we have to sensitize people about it and the damage that this has caused in the world, we have to bring awareness, so people can understand how massive the impact of it.
Everyone know that without people support is harder to make big changes happen so this is our plan.We are starting with social media to attract people attention, posting every day
videos with us cleaning the plastic from the ocean to sensitize people to join our cause of creating the biggest corporation of purifying the ocean habitat.
At the same time we are starting the biggest ocean pollution protest march so not only we clean up “the plastic from the big companies” we have to considerably reduce the use of plastic in the world by manifesting our thoughts and changing the law.
