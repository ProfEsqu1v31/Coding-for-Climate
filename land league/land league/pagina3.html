    <h1>Our Solution</h1>
    <p>The most viable and effective solution that we found to avoid soil erosion due to the use of agrochemicals, is the use of organic fertilizers, whose properties are completely beneficial for the soil and do not have an aggressive treatment with the soil, in addition to the fact that their use helps with soil recovery.</p>
    <dt>


        <dl>The main benefits of these natural fertilizers are:</dl>
        <dd>Natural fertilizers recover the organic matter that soils need. They promote the incorporation of nutrients by allowing them to retain them, contribute to carbon fixation and improve the absorption capacity of water. They promote soil aeration and reduce soil erosion and soil microbial activity is also increased.
            Natural fertilizers also allow organic waste to be used and do not require much energy to produce. By increasing soil temperature, organic growth fertilizers promote root formation and development, improving plant nutrition. Without this, soils would become cold, which can result in the degradation of their characteristics.
        </dd>
        <dd>An organic fertilizer is made from organic matter. They are natural compounds of various types that contain carbon molecules, such as animal or plant remains. It stands out for its intense and unpleasant smell. The smell is usually the result of rot and fermentation, which are unavoidable for all organic matter. There are several types of organic fertilizers. In terms of their origin, they can be divided into animal-based fertilizers, plant-based fertilizers and organic-mineral fertilizers. Here are some examples of fertilizers.

        <dl>Compost</dl>
        <dd>Compost is made from waste, which can be fruits, vegetables, pieces of cardboard, eggshells, dry grass, papers, tea bags, among other things. It is placed directly on the plants. It should be incorporated little by little and not replace the soil all at once. In agribusiness, there are machines called composting turners that flip the material to supply oxygen to the mixture and crush coarse materials.        </dd>
        <dl>Worm castings</dl>
        <dd>These are worm droppings used especially to transform organic waste, including those produced by the worms themselves. They are among the best natural fertilizers to use with plants and only require Californian worms. They are ideal for high-yielding crops, as they contain two trillion bacteria per gram of humus; Thanks to this, its use is effective in improving the biological properties of the soil. It is also incorporated every month and a half, directly onto the ground.</dd>
        <dl>Manure</dl>
        <dd>Compost is made from waste, which can be fruits, vegetables, pieces of cardboard, eggshells, dry grass, papers, tea bags, among other things. It is placed directly on the plants.
