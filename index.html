    5th year students from Colegio del Arce, located in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires - Argentina, took the challenge of working with the four Leagues proposed by the NGO organizing the project.
    Divided into four different work teams and using Design Thinking strategies, they carried out an investigation and selection of a problem and then proposed a solution. 
    Once the research process was completed, they designed and developed a website with HTML and CSS 3 languages, through which they seek to raise awareness about the problem addressed  and show what solution they thought of.
    As an Institution, we are proud that our students participate and get involved in raising awareness of the importance of caring for the environment, showing a great commitment to our planet.
