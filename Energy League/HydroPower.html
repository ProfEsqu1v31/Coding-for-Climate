    <h1 class="tomyh1">What is hydro power?</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Hydropower harnesses the power of water to generate electricity through infrastructure
    such as dams, reservoirs, and power plants. 
    <br>
    Hydroelectric power plants convert the potential
    energy of water into electrical energy by circulating it between two points of different heights.
    The turbine converts the kinetic energy of the water into mechanical energy, which is then
    transformed into electricity by a generator. The process has a high yield, harnessing almost
    all of the water's energy. Losses are due to factors such as friction and rotation. Pumped
   storage plants perform the reverse process, converting electricity into potentialÂ energy.

   <h1 class="tomyh1">Hydroelectric energy should be used for these reasons:</h1>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h1 class="tomyh1">Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions: </h1>
   <br>
   <p class="otracosa">
   Hydropower plants generate electricity without producing direct emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).
   <br>
    This contrasts with fossil fuel power plants, which release large amounts of CO2 contributing to global warming and climate change.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
   </p>
<h1 class="tomyh1">Air Pollution Reduction:</h1>
<br>
<p class="otracosa">
By avoiding the combustion of fossil fuels, hydropower significantly reduces air pollution including emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) that contribute to smog and acid rain formation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h1 class="tomyh1">Water and Aquatic Ecosystem Protection:</h1>
<br>
<p class="otracosa">
While hydropower dams can alter natural river flows, they also contribute to sustainable water management and conservation of aquatic ecosystems.
<br>
 Dams can regulate water flows, reduce flood risks, and create habitats for wildlife.
 <br>
 <br>
</p>
 <br>
<h1 class="tomyh1">Minimal Soil and Landscape Impact:</h1>
<br>
<p class="otracosa">
Unlike coal mines or oil drilling sites, the construction of hydropower plants does not involve massive landscape destruction or soil contamination with toxic chemicals.
<br>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1 class="tomyh1">Contribution to Climate Change Mitigation:</h1>
<br>
<p class="otracosa">

Hydropower is a key alternative for reducing carbon emissions and promoting the transition to a low-carbon economy. By relying less on fossil fuels, hydropower directly contributes to climate change mitigation.
