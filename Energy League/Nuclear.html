    <h1 class="tomyh1">What is nuclear energy?</h1>
    <p class="otracosa">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Nuclear power, the use of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and 
    electricity, contributes nearly 20 percent of the electricity to produce reliable, 
    low-carbon energy and to support national defense activities. 
                
    The Energy Department's Office of Nuclear Energyâ€™s primary mission is to 
    advance nuclear power as a resource capable of making major contributions.

    <h1 class="tomyh1">Nuclear energy should be used for these reasons:</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Nuclear energy represents an important and efficient source of energy that can play a significant role in reducing environmental pollution.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1">Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Nuclear power plants generate electricity without producing direct emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).
    <br>
    This contrasts with power plants that rely on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, which release large amounts of CO2 and contribute to global warming and climate change.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h1 class="tomyh1">Energy Efficiency and High Production: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Nuclear energy is highly efficient in terms of the amount of energy produced by a small amount of nuclear material. 
    <br>
    Nuclear power plants can generate large amounts of electricity consistently, contributing to reliable energy supply without dependence on weather conditions.
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1">Air Pollution Reduction: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    By not producing atmospheric pollutants like sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), common in the combustion of fossil fuels, nuclear energy helps improve air quality and reduces negative health impacts associated with air pollution.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h1 class="tomyh1"> Use of Natural Resources: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Compared to power plants that burn coal, oil, or natural gas, nuclear power plants require fewer natural resources in terms of extraction and transportation of fossil fuels, which can reduce environmental degradation associated with these activities.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h1 class="tomyh1">Energy Stability and Security: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Nuclear energy provides a stable source of electricity that contributes to energy security by diversifying the energy mix and reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels.
    <br>

    While nuclear energy presents significant challenges, such as safe management of radioactive waste and operational safety, many proponents argue that its benefits in terms of pollution reduction and climate change mitigation make it a valuable option in transitioning to a more sustainable, low-carbon energy system."
