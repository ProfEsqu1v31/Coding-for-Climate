    <h1>1. Xiaomi Air Charger: </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Xiaomi has introduced Mi Air Charge, a remote wireless charging 
    system that eliminates the need for cables or charging docks. 
    It can charge multiple devices simultaneously at a distance
    of several meters, even through physical obstacles, with a power of 5W.
    The technology is based on spatial positioning and power transmission using 
    phase interference and millimeter wave antennas. A receiver assembly is
    required on the device that converts the signals into electrical energy.
    Although the charging speed is not very high, the technology promises
    greater convenience in charging mobile devices and wearables, although 
    it is still in the development phase and has not been released commercially.

    <h1>2. 50 Years Batery: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    <br>
    Graphene promised to revolutionize our batteries, but it hasn't reached a large scale yet. Now, the focus is on atomic batteries, such as Betavolt Technology's BV100, which uses the isotope nickel-63 to generate power safely and durably. Although their current power is minimal, they can be combined to power devices such as drones or pacemakers. Future versions are expected to increase their potency and use other isotopes. Although they could be an option for devices, their cost would be high.

    <h1>3. Our proposals aim to minimize excessive electricity consumption and reduce the pollution generated by it as much as possible: </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Switch to LED bulbs:</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    LED bulbs consume significantly less electricity than traditional incandescent bulbs. Additionally, they last much longer, saving you money in the long run.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Unplug devices in standby mode:</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Many devices continue to consume energy even in standby mode. Disconnect them when not in use or use power strips with switches to turn off multiple devices at once.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Make use of natural light:</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Keep curtains open during the day to maximize sunlight and reduce the need for artificial lighting.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Use efficient appliances:</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    When buying new appliances, look for ones that are energy-efficient. Appliances with A+++ energy efficiency labels are the most efficient.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Wash clothes with cold water:</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Most of the energy used by a washing machine comes from heating water. Washing with cold water saves energy and keeps your clothes clean.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Optimize air conditioning and heating use:</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Adjust your home's temperature to avoid overusing air conditioning in summer or heating in winter. A few degrees can make a difference in your electricity bill.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Check your home's insulation:</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Good insulation helps maintain a constant temperature inside your house, reducing the load on heating and cooling systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Invest in solar panels or renewable energy: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    If possible, consider installing solar panels at home. Although the initial investment may be high, it will allow you to generate your own energy and significantly reduce your dependence on the conventional electrical grid.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Avoid phantom power usage: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Unplug device chargers (like cell phone or laptop chargers) when not in use. Chargers can continue to consume energy even when not charging anything.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Optimize hot water use:</h1> 
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Lower the water heater temperature and limit shower duration to save energy and water.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Regularly check your appliances: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Ensure your appliances are operating efficiently. Sometimes, simple cleaning or maintenance can improve performance and reduce energy consumption.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">•Adopting Energy Storage Technologies: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    <br>
    Consider installing energy storage systems, such as home batteries or grid-connected storage systems. These systems allow you to store energy during periods of low consumption and use it when it's most efficient.
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">Monitoring and Analyzing Energy Consumption: </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    Use advanced monitoring devices to analyze and better understand your energy consumption patterns. This will enable you to identify areas for improvement and take specific actions to reduce consumption.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">Implementing Efficient Ventilation Technologies: </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="otracosa">
    <br>
    Use heat recovery ventilation (HRV) or heat exchange systems in homes and buildings to reduce heat loss and maintain a comfortable temperature with minimal energy consumption.
    <br>

    <br>
    <h1>Our conclusion:</h1> 
    <br>
    <br><br>
    <h1 class="tomyh1devuelta">
    For us, energy conservation is very important because it is one of the largest sources of pollution and is the most utilized resource by humans every day. Just thinking about how leaving chargers for cell phones, notebooks, and tablets connected contributes significantly to pollution, and realizing that this is a common practice worldwide, makes us reflect on how misinformed the world is and how little we contribute to a better future with less pollution.

    Throughout our research, we identified energy sources that cause significant pollution of which we were previously unaware, and we found solutions to these problems. Moving forward, we are committed to avoiding these mistakes in order to protect the planet and to promote awareness among others, so that we can all live better.
