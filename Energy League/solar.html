        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="otracosa">
            Solar energy is the Earth's mother energy. Thanks to solar radiation, 
            for example, plants perform chlorophyll photosynthesis and kick-start 
            the process that enables the survival of living beings inhabiting the planet. 
            Solar radiation is also the origin of winds, tides, and fossil fuels: 
            the Sun is the primary driver of nearly all forms of energy on our planet. 
            It helps drive cleaner economies that protect the environment, improve people's 
            well-being, and ensure business sustainability.

        <h1 class="tomyh1">Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</h1>
    
        <p class="otracosa">
        <br>
        Solar panels generate electricity without producing any direct emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). This contrasts with fossil fuel power plants, which release large amounts of CO2 contributing to global warming and climate change.        <br>

        <h1 class="tomyh1">Air Pollution Reduction:</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="otracosa">
            By harnessing sunlight to produce electricity, solar energy significantly reduces air pollution compared to traditional fossil fuel combustion. It eliminates emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter that contribute to smog and respiratory diseases.        <br>

        <h1 class="tomyh1">Renewable and Sustainable:</h1>
        <p class="otracosa">
        <br>
        Solar energy is a renewable resource that is continuously replenished by solar radiation. Harnessing solar energy contributes to a sustainable energy future by reducing dependence on finite fossil fuel reserves.
